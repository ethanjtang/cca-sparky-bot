# sparky-bot

This bot is meant to act as a useful tool for a chess-related discord with various 
commands which call the Lichess or chess.com API for stats, to create games, etc.
Currently, games can only be created on Lichess because of Chess.com's API limitations.
(Correct me if I'm wrong though since this is my first big project)

***Features In Progress***
1) Implement all TODO comments.
2) Add a method using Google Sheets API to store Discord, chess.com, and Lichess usernames for simpler !challenge or !create_game calls for end users.
3) Add more detailed comments.
